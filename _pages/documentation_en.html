	<b>KARUTA</b> is an opensource software for the construction of electronic portfolios. It is
	a flexible tool that allows the design of portfolios for multiple purposes: showcasing, support 
	to learning, support to learning assessment.
</p>
<p>
	Portfolio development may be done starting from scratch with the basic elements supplied in 
	Karuta, or from templates supplied by the community and then adapted for specific needs.
</p>

<p>The Karuta documentation is organized in three sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href='portfolio_fr.html'>Portfolio</a></li>
	<li><a href='report_fr.html'>Report Script</a></li>
	<li><a href='batch_fr.html'>Batch Script</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	The <b><a href='portfolio_fr.html'>Portfolio</a></b> section presents the structural elements,
	the resources (elements that will contain the data), the metadata and the layout (CSS).
</p>
<p>
	The <b><a href='report_fr.html'>Report Script</a></b> section presents the commands used to build
	tables and dashboards, the layout of tables, and tables that can be edited by end users. The report
	script commands are used to navigate through portfolios, select certain elements, and display those
	elements in a table.
</p>
<p>
	The <b><a href='batch_fr.html'>Batch Script</a></b> section presents the commands used to automate
	creating, updating and deleting portfolios, as well as creating or deleting user accounts.
</p>

<h3>General Remarks</h3>
<p>
	KARUTA is multilingual (by default English and French). The element labels are saved in the
	language selected in the language menu. In end user menus and end user help nodes, labels must
	be appended with the language code and separated by the slash <code>/</code>. 
	Example : Add a photo@en/Ajouter une photo@fr
</p>
<p>
	A Karuta user is associated to a specific portfolio in a specific role - for example the student
	or teacher role (the designer decides on the role names). For each portfolio, a user group is 
	created for each role the designer has defined. Then, to associate a user with a role, this user
	is placed in the corresponding user group.
</p>
<p> There are three predefined roles:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<code>designer</code> This is the user that builds portfolios. This person has all the rights
		and permissions on all the portfolio elements, without regard to the roles specified in the
		metadata of an element.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>all</code> This keyword includes all roles defined on the portfolio.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>user</code> This keyword will be replaced by the ID of the end user at the time of 
		portfolio instanciation. Only this specific user may then have this role.
	</li>
</ul>
