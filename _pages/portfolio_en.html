<p>Karuta portfolios are represented by structured trees (see STRUCTURES).</p>
<p>There are multiple types of Karuta trees:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Portfolio Model</li>
	<li>Portfolio Instance</li>
	<li>Rubrics Portfolio</li>
	<li>Reusable Components Portfolio</li>
	<li>Report Script</li>
	<li>Batch Script</li>
	<li>Batch Form</li>
</ul>
<h3>Portfolio Model</h3>
<p>
	A portfolio model is a tree structure that organizes resources. Resources are the elements that 
	will contain data: data supplied to the users like instructions or files, and data supplied by 
	the users to populate their portfolios. Karuta offers resources of many types: text fields, text 
	editors, files, images, audio and video players, date fields, etc.
</p>
<p>
	Once constructed by the designer, the portfolio model is instantiated for each user, which means 
	that a copy of the model is created and the new tree is the portfolio for that specific user.
</p>
<h3>Portfolio Instance</h3>
<p>
	A portfolio instance is a copy of the model for a specific user. At the moment of instantiation 
	(e.g., copying), roles and permissions are created for each element of the portfolio.
</p>
<h3>Rubrics Portfolio</h3>
<p>
	A rubrics portfolio contains elements that will be referenced in other portfolios, for example a 
	competency framework or elements of a choice-box.
</p>
<h3>Reusable Components Portfolio</h3>
<p>
	A reusable components portfolio is used to contain pre-built portfolio parts that will then be
	made available to a user through a menu. This allows users to add parts to their portfolio as
	needed.
</p>
<h3>Report Script</h3>
<p>
	A report script contains commands to select elements from one or multiple portfolios and
	display them with in a different layout. For exemple, building dashboards, resumes, or cohort
	aggregate reports. The report commands allow you to navigate through portfolios to select the
	elements to display. The result is displayed in an html table, the layout of which is 
	customizable by the designer.
</p>
<h3>Batch Script</h3>
<p>
	A batch script contains commands to automate the process of creating user accounts, 
	portfolios, and updating information. A batch script is usually associated to a 
	CSV file containing, for example, a list of intended users. Executing the batch script
	with this file would then automatically create the user accounts and their portfolios. 
	A batch script may also be associated to a batch form.
</p>
<h3>Batch Form</h3>
<p>
	A batch form executes a batch script for one single line, without the need for a CSV file.
</p>

<h2>Operational Principles</h2>
<p>
	A Kartua portfolio is built by adding branches to the root element, thus constructing a tree 
	structure. The process is much like an assembly of Lego blocks. Certain branches, such as the 
	basic Karuta elements, are predefined. Designers combine these basic elements to construct 
	branches, and combines these branches to build complex portfolios.
</p>
<p>
	User menus may also be defined, allowing the end user to add branches to their portfolio 
	as need be (this is where the reusable components portfolio is called upon). This way the
	portfolio is customizable by the end user.
</p>

<h3>Models and Instances</h3>
<p>There are two types of Karuta portfolios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Portfolio model — Built by the designer. The associated roles are <i>designer</i> and 
	<i>all</i>.
</li>
<li>Portfolio instance — Instantiated from a portfolio model for each individual user. 
	The associated roles are those defined by the designer in the model (plus <i>designer</i> 
	and <i>all</i>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the relationship between these two types of portfolios:</p>

<h3>The security model</h3>
<p></p>
<img src='../assets/img/modele-securite.png' width='50%'/>
<ul>
	<li>A portfolio has associated roles.</li>
	<li>A role has associated permissions (read, write, submit, etc.) for each of the portfolio
	 elements.
	</li>
	<li>Sharing a portfolio is done by associating a user and a role.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simulation of the custom roles by the designer</h3>
<p>
	From the portfolio model, the designer may (and should!) simulate the various roles created 
	for the portfolio users.
