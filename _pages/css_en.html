<p>
	The CSS Styles tab in the editing dialog box of any Karuta element allows you to tweak it's appearance. 
	The appearance of the element's label and content are specified separately. The content of a structural 
	element is all elements inside it, whereas the content of a resource element is the data it contains.
</p>	
<p>
	Pre-defined fields allow you to specify font weight, style, size and color, text alignment, space before 
	(CSS "padding-top" instruction) and background color. A textField also allows you to specify your own well 
	formed CSS code (field "Other CSS Instructions").
</p>	
<p>
	If multiple elements require the same CSS styling, you may define a CSS class in the Root element of the
	portfolio (field "CSS") and simply tag this class in the intended elements (field "CSS Class").
